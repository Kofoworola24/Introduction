\## üîå Introduction to Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers



\### With Practical Insights Using Arduino Uno and ESP32



Embedded systems are specialized computing systems that perform dedicated tasks within larger systems ‚Äî often with real-time performance and efficiency. These systems are \*\*‚Äúembedded‚Äù into hardware\*\*, like home appliances, medical devices, industrial machines, and IoT devices.



At the heart of many embedded systems are \*\*microcontrollers\*\* ‚Äî compact integrated circuits that combine a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals.



\### ü§ñ What You‚Äôll Learn



In this course/lesson, we‚Äôll explore the \*\*fundamentals of embedded systems and electronics\*\*, using two of the most popular microcontroller platforms in hobbyist and prototyping circles:



---



\### üü¶ \*\*Arduino Uno\*\* ‚Äì The Classic Starter



\* \*\*Microcontroller\*\*: ATmega328P

\* \*\*Clock Speed\*\*: 16 MHz

\* \*\*Flash Memory\*\*: 32 KB

\* \*\*Digital I/O Pins\*\*: 14 (6 PWM)

\* \*\*Analog Input Pins\*\*: 6

\* \*\*Connectivity\*\*: USB only (no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth)

\* \*\*Best for\*\*: Beginners learning electronics, sensors, LEDs, motors



\*\*Use Case Example\*\*:

Turn on an LED when a button is pressed, or read temperature from a sensor and display it on an LCD. Simple, reliable, and beginner-friendly.

\### üåê \*\*ESP32\*\* ‚Äì The IoT Powerhouse



\* \*\*Microcontroller\*\*: Tensilica Xtensa dual-core 32-bit

\* \*\*Clock Speed\*\*: Up to 240 MHz

\* \*\*Flash Memory\*\*: Up to 4MB+

\* \*\*Digital I/O Pins\*\*: 30+

\* \*\*Analog Inputs\*\*: Multiple (more than Arduino)

\* \*\*Connectivity\*\*: \*\*Built-in Wi-Fi \& Bluetooth\*\*

\* \*\*Best for\*\*: Wireless projects, real-time IoT applications, edge computing



\*\*Use Case Example\*\*:

Build a smart home device that sends sensor data to your phone over Wi-Fi or controls your lights via Bluetooth. Far more powerful than the Arduino Uno for connected applications.
