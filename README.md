## 🔌 Introduction to Embedded Systems and Microcontrollers

### With Practical Insights Using Arduino Uno and ESP32

Embedded systems are specialized computing systems that perform dedicated tasks within larger systems — often with real-time performance and efficiency. These systems are **“embedded” into hardware**, like home appliances, medical devices, industrial machines, and IoT devices.

At the heart of many embedded systems are **microcontrollers** — compact integrated circuits that combine a processor, memory, and input/output (I/O) peripherals.

### 🤖 What You’ll Learn

In this course/lesson, we’ll explore the **fundamentals of embedded systems and electronics**, using two of the most popular microcontroller platforms in hobbyist and prototyping circles:

---

### 🟦 **Arduino Uno** – The Classic Starter

* **Microcontroller**: ATmega328P
* **Clock Speed**: 16 MHz
* **Flash Memory**: 32 KB
* **Digital I/O Pins**: 14 (6 PWM)
* **Analog Input Pins**: 6
* **Connectivity**: USB only (no Wi-Fi or Bluetooth)
* **Best for**: Beginners learning electronics, sensors, LEDs, motors

**Use Case Example**:
Turn on an LED when a button is pressed, or read temperature from a sensor and display it on an LCD. Simple, reliable, and beginner-friendly.

### 🌐 **ESP32** – The IoT Powerhouse

* **Microcontroller**: Tensilica Xtensa dual-core 32-bit
* **Clock Speed**: Up to 240 MHz
* **Flash Memory**: Up to 4MB+
* **Digital I/O Pins**: 30+
* **Analog Inputs**: Multiple (more than Arduino)
* **Connectivity**: **Built-in Wi-Fi & Bluetooth**
* **Best for**: Wireless projects, real-time IoT applications, edge computing

**Use Case Example**:
Build a smart home device that sends sensor data to your phone over Wi-Fi or controls your lights via Bluetooth. Far more powerful than the Arduino Uno for connected applications.
